# English-Spanish-Translator

This is an English to Spanish tranlator written in python that opens in your browser.  
This is nothing special, I just felt like making it.  
I do plan on expanding this in the future to include language detection and more languages to choose from.  
  
**To run** it use the command: *streamlit run main.py*  
  
Packages used:
- Streamlit (https://streamlit.io/)  
- Translate (https://github.com/terryyin/translate-python)
